# TkinterQuestionnaireExample
This is a project I did on a software proposal to help children to read more for the PISA program in Mexico. It is a questionnaire in Tkinter that analyzes the answers of the users to get their likes and needs and recommend 3 books from a database that I created.  You can also register users to save their books so they can access them at any time.
